    "text": "CIH, also known as Chernobyl or Spacefiller, is a Microsoft Windows 9x computer virus which first emerged in 1998. Its payload is highly destructive to vulnerable systems, overwriting critical information on infected system drives, and in some cases destroying the system BIOS. The virus was created by Chen Ing-hau (\u9673\u76c8\u8c6a, pinyin: Ch\u00e9n Y\u00edngh\u00e1o) who was a student at Tatung University in Taiwan. Now he is the chief executive officer and founder of 8tory. Sixty million computers were believed to be infected by the virus internationally, resulting in an estimated US$1 billion in commercial damages.Chen claimed to have written the virus as a challenge against bold claims of antiviral efficiency by antivirus software developers. Chen stated that after the virus was spread across Tatung University by classmates, he apologized to the school and made an antivirus program available for public download; the antivirus program was co-authored with Weng Shi-hao (\u7fc1\u4e16\u8c6a), a student at Tamkang University. Prosecutors in Taiwan could not charge Chen at the time because no victims came forward with a lawsuit. These events led to new computer crime legislation in Taiwan.The name \"Chernobyl Virus\" was coined some time after the virus was already well known as CIH, and refers to the complete coincidence of the payload trigger date in some variants of the virus (actually the virus creation date in 1998, to trigger exactly a year later) and the Chernobyl disaster, which happened in the Soviet Union on April 26, 1986.\nThe name \"Spacefiller\" was introduced because most viruses write their code to the end of the infected file\u2014however, CIH looks for gaps in the existing program code, where it then writes its own code. This does not increase the file size and in that way helps the virus avoid detection.",

    "text": "Flame, also known as Flamer, sKyWIper, and Skywiper, is modular computer malware discovered in 2012 that attacks computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system.  The program is being used for targeted cyber espionage in Middle Eastern countries.Its discovery was announced on 28 May 2012 by MAHER Center of Iranian National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), Kaspersky Lab and CrySyS Lab of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The last of these stated in its report that Flame \"is certainly the most sophisticated malware we encountered during our practice; arguably, it is the most complex malware ever found.\" Flame can spread to other systems over a local network (LAN) or via USB stick. It can record audio, screenshots, keyboard activity and network traffic. The program also records Skype conversations and can turn infected computers into Bluetooth beacons which attempt to download contact information from nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices. This data, along with locally stored documents, is sent on to one of several command and control servers that are scattered around the world. The program then awaits further instructions from these servers.According to estimates by Kaspersky in May 2012, Flame had initially infected approximately 1,000 machines, with victims including governmental organizations, educational institutions and private individuals. At that time 65% of the infections happened in Iran, Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, with a \"huge majority of targets\" within Iran. Flame has also been reported in Europe and North America.  Flame supports a \"kill\" command which wipes all traces of the malware from the computer. The initial infections of Flame stopped operating after its public exposure, and the \"kill\" command was sent.Flame is linked to the Equation Group by Kaspersky Lab. However, Costin Raiu, the director of Kaspersky Lab's global research and analysis team, believes the group only cooperates with the creators of Flame and Stuxnet from a position of superiority: \"Equation Group are definitely the masters, and they are giving the others, maybe, bread crumbs. From time to time they are giving them some goodies to integrate into Stuxnet and Flame.\"",

    "text": "Mydoom, also known as  W32.MyDoom@mm, Novarg, Mimail.R and Shimgapi, is a computer worm affecting Microsoft Windows. It was first sighted on January 26, 2004. It became the fastest-spreading e-mail worm ever (as of  January 2004), exceeding previous records set by the Sobig worm and ILOVEYOU, a record which as of 2019 has yet to be surpassed.Mydoom appears to have been commissioned by e-mail spammers so as to send junk e-mail through infected computers. The worm contains the text message \"andy; I'm just doing my job, nothing personal, sorry,\" leading many to believe that the worm's creator was paid. Early on, several security firms expressed their belief that the worm originated from a programmer in Russia. The actual author of the worm is unknown.\nSpeculative early coverage held that the sole purpose of the worm was to perpetrate a distributed denial-of-service attack against SCO Group. 25 percent of Mydoom.A-infected hosts targeted www.sco.com with a flood of traffic. Trade press conjecture, spurred on by SCO Group's own claims, held that this meant the worm was created by a Linux or open source supporter in retaliation for SCO Group's controversial legal actions and public statements against Linux. This theory was rejected immediately by security researchers. Since then, it has been likewise rejected by law enforcement agents investigating the virus, who attribute it to organized online crime gangs.Initial analysis of Mydoom suggested that it was a variant of the Mimail worm\u2014hence the alternate name Mimail.R\u2014prompting speculation that the same people were responsible for both worms. Later analyses were less conclusive as to the link between the two worms.\nMydoom was named by Craig Schmugar, an employee of computer security firm McAfee and one of the earliest discoverers of the worm. Schmugar chose the name after noticing the text \"mydom\" within a line of the program's code. He noted: \"It was evident early on that this would be very big. I thought having 'doom' in the name would be appropriate.\"",

The attack utilized a trojan that targeted computers running Microsoft Windows, and was believed to have first been posted to the Internet on 5 September 2013. It propagated via infected email attachments, and via an existing Gameover ZeuS botnet. When activated, the malware encrypted certain types of files stored on local and mounted network drives using RSA public-key cryptography, with the private key stored only on the malware's control servers. The malware then displayed a message which offered to decrypt the data if a payment (through either bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher) was made by a stated deadline, and it threatened to delete the private key if the deadline passes. If the deadline was not met, the malware offered to decrypt data via an online service provided by the malware's operators, for a significantly higher price in bitcoin. There was no guarantee that payment would release the encrypted content.\nAlthough CryptoLocker itself was easily removed, the affected files remained encrypted in a way which researchers considered unfeasible to break. Many said that the ransom should not be paid, but did not offer any way to recover files; others said that paying the ransom was the only way to recover files that had not been backed up. Some victims claimed that paying the ransom did not always lead to the files being decrypted. \nCryptoLocker was isolated in late May 2014 via Operation Tovar, which took down the Gameover ZeuS botnet that had been used to distribute the malware. During the operation, a security firm involved in the process obtained the database of private keys used by CryptoLocker, which was in turn used to build an online tool for recovering the keys and files without paying the ransom. It is believed that the operators of CryptoLocker successfully extorted a total of around $3 million from victims of the trojan. Other instances of encryption-based ransomware that have followed have used the \"CryptoLocker\" name (or variations), but are otherwise unrelated.",

    "text": "Klez is a computer worm that propagates via e-mail. It first appeared in October 2001. A number of variants of the worm exist.\nKlez infects Microsoft Windows systems, exploiting a vulnerability in Internet Explorer's Trident layout engine, used by both Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express to render HTML mail.\nThe e-mail through which the worm spreads always includes a text portion and one or more attachments. The text portion consists of either an HTML internal frame tag which causes buggy e-mail clients to automatically execute the worm, or a few lines of text that attempt to induce the recipient to execute the worm by opening the attachment (sometimes by claiming that the attachment is a patch from Microsoft; sometimes by claiming that the attachment is an antidote for the Klez worm).  The first attachment is always the worm, whose internals vary.\nOnce the worm is executed, either automatically by the buggy HTML engine or manually by a user, it searches for addresses to send itself to. When it sends itself out, it may attach a file from the infected machine, leading to possible privacy breaches.\nLater variants of the worm would use a false From address, picking an e-mail address at random from the infected machine's Outlook or Outlook Express address book, making it impossible for casual observers to determine which machine is infected, and making it difficult for experts to determine anything more than the infected machine's Internet Service Provider.",

    "text": "Jerusalem is a DOS virus first detected in Jerusalem,  in October 1987. On infection, the Jerusalem virus becomes memory resident (using 2kb of memory), and then infects every executable file run, except for COMMAND.COM. COM files grow by 1,813 bytes when infected by Jerusalem and are not re-infected. .EXE files grow by 1,808 to 1,823 bytes each time they are infected. The virus re-infects .EXE files each time the files are loaded until they are too large to load into memory. Some .EXE files are infected but do not grow because several overlays follow the genuine .EXE file in the same file. Sometimes .EXE files are incorrectly infected, causing the program to fail to run as soon as it is executed.\nThe virus code itself hooks into interrupt processing and other low level DOS services.  For example, code in the virus suppresses the printing of console messages if, for example, the virus is not able to infect a file on a read-only device such as a floppy disk.  One of the clues that a computer is infected is the mis-capitalization of the well-known message \"Bad command or file name\" as \"Bad Command or file name\".\nThe program contains one destructive payload that is set to go off on Friday the 13th on all years but 1987. On that date, the virus deletes every program file that was executed.  Jerusalem is also known as BlackBox because of a black box it displays during the payload sequence. If the system is in text mode, Jerusalem creates a small black rectangle from row 5, column 5 to row 16, column 16. The rectangle is scrolled up by two lines.\nAs a result of the virus hooking into the low-level timer interrupt, PC-XT systems slow down to one fifth of their normal speeds 30 minutes after the virus has installed itself. The slowdown is less noticeable on faster machines.  The virus contains code that enters a processing loop each time the processor's timer tick is activated.\nSymptoms also include spontaneous disconnection of workstations from networks and creation of large printer spooling files.  Disconnections occur since Jerusalem uses the 'interrupt 21h' low-level DOS functions that Novell Netware and other networking implementations required to hook into the file system.\nJerusalem was initially very common (for a virus of the day) and spawned a large number of variants.  However, since the advent of Windows, these DOS interrupts are no longer used, so Jerusalem and its variants have become obsolete.",

The malware targets specific users of Microsoft Windows-based computers and has been linked to the US intelligence gathering agency NSA and its British counterpart, the GCHQ. The Intercept provided samples of Regin for download including malware discovered at Belgian telecommunications provider, Belgacom. Kaspersky Lab says it first became aware of Regin in spring 2012, but that some of the earliest samples date from 2003. (The name Regin is first found on the VirusTotal website on 9 March 2011.) Among computers infected worldwide by Regin, 28 percent were in Russia, 24 percent in Saudi Arabia, 9 percent each in Mexico and Ireland, and 5 percent in each of India, Afghanistan, Iran, Belgium, Austria and Pakistan. Kaspersky Lab have recently discovered multiple attack vectors used. USB, & BIOS modification allows the bulk of malware to be injected through ports 1,2,3 & 5. Many extra services & processes are visible to the victim. The 'back room' of the creators finds collisions in SHA2 message digests, suggesting a lot of CPU time is taken up. If the virus-software updates slightly altered updates (per user e.g. 256 bytes of random data), collisions for every user would have to be carried out. Kaspersky has said the malware's main victims are private individuals, small businesses and telecom companies. Regin has been compared to Stuxnet and is thought to have been developed by \"well-resourced teams of developers\", possibly a Western government, as a targeted multi-purpose data collection tool.According to Die Welt, security experts at Microsoft gave it the name \"Regin\" in 2011, after the cunning Norse dwarf Regin.",

It is now defunct, and its master key was released by the developers.\nIn its early forms, TeslaCrypt targeted game-play data for specific computer games. Newer variants of the malware also affect other file types.\nIn its original, game-player campaign, upon infection the malware searched for 185 file extensions related to 40 different games, which include the Call of Duty series, World of Warcraft, Minecraft and World of Tanks, and encrypted such files. The files targeted involve the save data, player profiles, custom maps and game mods stored on the victim's hard drives. Newer variants of TeslaCrypt were not focused on computer games alone but also encrypted Word, PDF, JPEG and other files. In all cases, the victim would then be prompted to pay a ransom of $500 worth of bitcoins in order to obtain the key to decrypt the files.Although resembling CryptoLocker in form and function, Teslacrypt shares no code with CryptoLocker and was developed independently. The malware infected computers via the Angler Adobe Flash exploit.Even though the ransomware claimed TeslaCrypt used asymmetric encryption, researchers from Cisco's Talos Group found that symmetric encryption was used and developed a decryption tool for it.  This \"deficiency\" was changed in version 2.0, rendering it impossible to decrypt files affected by TeslaCrypt-2.0.By November 2015, security researchers from Kaspersky had been quietly circulating that there was a new weakness in version 2.0, but carefully keeping that knowledge away from the malware developer so that they could not fix the flaw. As of January 2016, a new version 3.0 was discovered that had fixed the flaw.A full behavior report, which shows BehaviorGraphs and ExecutionGraphs was published by JoeSecurity.In May 2016, the developers of TeslaCrypt shut down the ransomware and released the master decryption key, thus bringing an end to the ransomware. After a few days, ESET released a public tool to decrypt affected computers at no charge.\n\n",

In this way it spread onto the European Academic Research Network (EARN), BITNET, and IBM's worldwide VNET. On all of these systems it caused massive disruption.\nThe core mechanism of the ILOVEYOU worm of 2000 was essentially the same as Christmas Tree, although it ran on PCs rather than mainframes, was spread over a different network, and was scripted using VBScript rather than REXX.\nThe name was actually \"CHRISTMA EXEC\" because the IBM VM systems originally required file names to be formatted as 8+space+8 characters. Additionally, IBM required REXX script files to have a file type of \"EXEC\". The name is sometimes written as \"CHRISTMAS EXEC\" (adding a 9th character) to make the name more readable.

In June 2017, a new variant of Petya was used for a global cyberattack, primarily targeting Ukraine. The new variant propagates via the EternalBlue exploit, which is generally believed to have been developed by the  U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), and was used earlier in the year by the WannaCry ransomware. Kaspersky Lab referred to this new version as NotPetya to distinguish it from the 2016 variants, due to these differences in operation. In addition, although it purports to be ransomware, this variant was modified so that it is unable to actually revert its own changes.",

It appeared on Wednesday, February 18, 2004. 18-year-old Sven Jaschan of Germany confessed to having written these, and other worms, such as Sasser. \nAlthough individual functions vary widely from virus to virus, the Netsky family perhaps is most famous for comments contained within the code of its variants insulting the authors of the Bagle and Mydoom worm families and, in some cases, routines that removed versions of these viruses. The \"war\" as it was referred to in the media caused a steady increase in the number of variant viruses produced in these families. As of June 2004, Bagle had approximately 28, Netsky approximately 29, and MyDoom approximately 10.\nOther symptoms of Netsky included beeping sounds on specified dates, usually in the morning hours.\nThe worm was sent out as an e-mail, enticing recipients to open an attachment. Once opened, the attached program would scan the computer for e-mail addresses and e-mail itself to all addresses found.\nUntil October 2006, the P variant of this virus remained the most prevalent virus being sent in e-mail throughout the world, despite being over two and a half years old. It was surpassed by a variant from the Stration malware family in November 2006.",

    "text": "Cabir (also known as Caribe, SybmOS/Cabir, Symbian/Cabir and EPOC.cabir) is the name of a computer worm developed in 2004 that is designed to infect mobile phones running Symbian OS. It is believed to be the first computer worm that can infect mobile phones.  When a phone is infected with Cabir, the message \"Caribe\" is displayed on the phone's display, and is displayed every time the phone is turned on. The worm then attempts to spread to other phones in the area using wireless Bluetooth signals.\nThe worm was not sent out into the wild, but sent directly to anti-virus firms, who believe Cabir in its current state is harmless. However, it does prove that mobile phones are also at risk from virus writers.  Experts also believe that the worm was developed by a group who call themselves 29A, a group of international hackers, as a \"proof of concept\" worm in order to catch world attention. Several firms subsequently released tools to remove the worm, the first of which was the Australian business TSG Pacific.The worm can attack and replicate on Bluetooth enabled Series 60 phones. The worm tries to send itself to all Bluetooth enabled devices that support  the \"Object Push Profile\", which can also be non-Symbian phones, desktop computers or even printers. The worm spreads as a .sis file installed in the Apps directory. Cabir does not spread if the user does not accept the file-transfer or does not agree with the installation, though some older phones would keep on displaying popups, as Cabir re-sent itself, rendering the UI useless until yes is clicked. \nCabir is the first mobile malware ever discovered While the worm is considered harmless because it replicates but does not perform any other activity, it will result in shortened battery life on portable devices due to constant scanning for other Bluetooth enabled devices.\nCabir was named by the employees of Kaspersky Lab after their colleague Elena Kabirova.Mabir, a variant of Cabir, is capable of spreading not only via Bluetooth but also via MMS.  By sending out copies of itself as a .sis file over cellular networks, it can affect even users who are outside the 10m range of Bluetooth.",

    "text": "Anna Kournikova (named by its author as \"Vbs.OnTheFly Created By OnTheFly\") was a computer worm written by a 20-year-old Dutch student named Jan de Wit --who called himself 'OnTheFly'-- on February 11, 2001. It was designed to trick email users into opening a mail message purportedly containing a picture of the tennis player Anna Kournikova, while actually hiding a malicious program. The worm arrives in an email with the subject line \"Here you have, ;0)\" and an attached file called AnnaKournikova.jpg.vbs. When launched under Microsoft Windows the file does not display a picture of Anna Kournikova but launches a viral Visual Basic Script that forwards itself to everybody in the Microsoft Outlook address book of the victim.\nOnTheFly created Anna Kournikova using a simple and online available Visual Basic Worm Generator program by an Argentinian programmer called [K]Alamar.  While similar to the ILOVEYOU worm that struck a year earlier in 2000, the Anna Kournikova worm did not corrupt data on the infected computer. Still, it affected millions of people and caused problems in email servers around the world.Apparently, the author created the worm in a matter of hours. \"The young man had downloaded a program on Sunday, February 11, from the Internet and later the same day, around 3:00 p.m., set the worm loose in a newsgroup.\"  De Wit turned himself in to authorities in the town of Sneek located in the northern Dutch province of Friesland. \"By the time he understood what the worm did, he had conferred with his parents and decided to turn himself in to the police.\"The efforts of virus writer working undercover for the FBI, David L. Smith (author of the Melissa virus, who was still serving his sentence) assisted in tracking down OnTheFly's real identity. De Wit turned himself in to the police in his hometown Sneek on February 14, 2001, after he posted a letter of confession on a website and a newsgroup of player Anna Kournikova (alt.binaries.anna-kournikova) dated February 13. In it, he admitted creating the virus using a toolkit and explained his motivations as to see whether the IT community had learned their lesson to better secure systems in the aftermath of previous virus infections. But besides admission and regret he also attributed external blame for the rate of spreading on the beauty of the tennis player (he had pinups of her on his website) and blamed those who opened the email, writing \"it's their own fault they got infected.\"Resembling the cases of other computer virus writers, a few days later the mayor of Sneek, Mayor Sieboldt Hartkamp made a tentative job offer to De Wit in the local administration's IT department, saying the city should be proud to have produced such a talented young man.De Wit was tried in Leeuwarden and was charged with spreading data into a computer network with the intention of causing damage, a crime that carried a maximum sentence of four years in prison and a fine of 100,000 guilders (US$41,300). The lawyers for Jan de Wit called for the dismissal of charges against him, arguing that the worm caused minimal damage. The FBI submitted evidence to the Dutch court and suggested that US$166,000 in damages was caused by the worm. He denied any intent to cause damage. De Wit was sentenced to 150 hours of community service.The 18-year-old Buenos Aires programmer who created the Worm Generator toolkit, removed the application's files from his website later in February 2001. \"Once they heard my alias being mentioned on television, my friends recommended that I do so,\" he told ZDNet Latin America in an interview.",

It was isolated in Hong Kong several times at the beginning of 1994, but did not become common until it spread to North America in the Spring of 1995. AntiCMOS is a fairly standard boot virus, and is primarily notable for being one of the few DOS viruses to remain in the wild as of 2005.\nAntiCMOS is so named because it has the intended effect of erasing all CMOS information. This does not occur because of a bug in the virus code.  This is true of all AntiCMOS variants that have appeared in the wild.  The payload date of December 1993 and the obsolete nature of these variants makes it very unlikely that AntiCMOS's payload will ever be a threat.\n\n",

Once installed on a PC, the worm copies itself into a Windows system folder, creates a new file displayed as \"Windows Genuine Advantage Validation Notification\" and becomes part of the computer's automatic startup. In addition, it attempts to send itself to all MSN contacts by offering an attachment named 'photos.zip'. Executing this file will install the worm onto the local PC. The Win32.IRCBot worm provides a backdoor server and allows a remote intruder to gain access and control over the computer via an Internet Relay Chat channel. This allows for confidential information to be transmitted to a hacker.\nBecause of a lack of standard naming conventions and also because of common features, variants of Win32.IRCBot can often be confused with the Agobot and Spybot family of worms.

The virus removes antivirus programs from remote computers before attempting to infect them. When first installed, it copies itself to the Windows and system directories. It uses filenames that resemble those of legitimate Windows system files in an attempt to remain hidden. It activates on the third day of each month; the first known activation happened on February 3, 2006. On activation, the virus overwrites data files of many common types, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents; ZIP and RAR archives; and PDFs. It can destroy files on fixed and removable drives and tries, but fails, to affect data on network drives. It also attempts to disable antivirus programs by removing the registry entries that automatically run them and deleting the antivirus programs directly.\nThe virus visits a tracking Web page each time it infects a computer. Over 300,000 unique IPs visited that site, suggesting that at least that many computers suffered infection. It is not known how many of them remained infected long enough to trigger the virus\u2019s payload.",

    "text": "Daprosy worm was a malicious computer program that spreads via local area network (LAN) connections, spammed e-mails and USB mass storage devices.  Infection comes from a single read1st.exe file where several dozen clones are created at once bearing the names of compromised folders.  The most obvious symptom of Daprosy infection is the presence of Classified.exe or Do not open - secrets!.exe files from infected folders.\nAlthough first observed in early May 2009, the worm was first announced to the public as Daprosy trojan worm by Symantec on July 2009 and was later identified as Autorun-AMS, Autorun-AMW and Autorun-APL by Sophos. It acquired additional aliases from antivirus companies and others tag it as an incarnation or variation of the Autorun.H.The worm belongs to the \u201cslow\u201d mass mailer category where copies of which are attached and sent to addresses intercepted from the keyboard.  The e-mail consists of a promotion of and installation instruction for an imaginary antivirus product purported to remove unknown infections from the computer.  While infection cannot occur until the attached worm is renamed and opened, it could spread to system folders in a matter of seconds. It is known to shut down or hang Windows Vista and Windows 7 when attempts to write on the system drive are denied by said operating systems. Also, the worm hides folders and makes them \"super hidden\" so that data contained in them are not easily accessed.\nPrecision key logging is the main threat associated with Daprosy infection.  Logged keystrokes containing sensitive data could be sent to its author using the worm\u2019s improvised mailing system.  Early strains are known to destabilize, corrupt and even stall the operating system due to programming bugs.  Said strains appear to be incomplete and were probably created by students or amateur Visual Basic programmers as evidenced by using VB decompilers.  Final or later releases of Daprosy worm are prolific online game password stealers.  They also pose great threats to banking and other e-commerce establishments.\nDaprosy worm is rampant in public Internet caf\u00e9s with LAN connections and exposed USB mass storage drives.  As of October 2009 special scripts are available to remove it from infected computers.  Many Windows system were stalled last November 13, 2009.  An initial investigation points to the older versions of Daprosy Worm, viz. Sophos Autorun-AMS and Autorun-AMW, which appear to be  \"Friday the Thirteenth\" malware.\nMore recent and persistent variants of Daprosy worm are still in circulation. A notable variant, Win32/Kashu.B as identified by Ahnlab, can be removed only by using live CD. Usually, such variants of Daprosy worm are infected by Sality viruses and usually have file size greater than 100 kilobytes. It now appears that Daprosy worm is a natural host to file-infecting viruses since the former is well distributed on all drives. Viral Daprosy exists in many variants which again requires special scripts to remove. Manual removal of worms infected with viruses requires knowledge usually belonging to individuals associated with AV companies.\nDaprosy is \"active\" even in Safe Mode which makes it difficult to manually remove.  Its key logging mechanism is so precise that it captures almost everything typed on the keyboard. This ranks Daprosy as one of the most dangerous worms of the last decade.",

It became the fastest-spreading e-mail worm ever (as of  January 2004), exceeding previous records set by the Sobig worm and ILOVEYOU, a record which as of 2019 has yet to be surpassed.Mydoom appears to have been commissioned by e-mail spammers so as to send junk e-mail through infected computers. The worm contains the text message \"andy; I'm just doing my job, nothing personal, sorry,\" leading many to believe that the worm's creator was paid. Early on, several security firms expressed their belief that the worm originated from a programmer in Russia. The actual author of the worm is unknown.\nSpeculative early coverage held that the sole purpose of the worm was to perpetrate a distributed denial-of-service attack against SCO Group. 25 percent of Mydoom.A-infected hosts targeted www.sco.com with a flood of traffic. Trade press conjecture, spurred on by SCO Group's own claims, held that this meant the worm was created by a Linux or open source supporter in retaliation for SCO Group's controversial legal actions and public statements against Linux. This theory was rejected immediately by security researchers. Since then, it has been likewise rejected by law enforcement agents investigating the virus, who attribute it to organized online crime gangs.Initial analysis of Mydoom suggested that it was a variant of the Mimail worm\u2014hence the alternate name Mimail.R\u2014prompting speculation that the same people were responsible for both worms. Later analyses were less conclusive as to the link between the two worms.\nMydoom was named by Craig Schmugar, an employee of computer security firm McAfee and one of the earliest discoverers of the worm. Schmugar chose the name after noticing the text \"mydom\" within a line of the program's code. He noted: \"It was evident early on that this would be very big. I thought having 'doom' in the name would be appropriate.\"",

When the virus went off, the title page credited \"Rancid Grapefruit\" and \"Cereal Killer\" of the \"Kool/Rad Alliance!\"\nThe phone number embedded in the detonation page was apparently the home number of John Maxfield (also known as \"Cable Pair\") a well-known FBI informant and private investigator of the era, whose specialty was computer crime and hackers.Unlike the few Apple viruses that had come before, such as the Elk Cloner virus, that were essentially annoying but did no damage, the Festering Hate series of viruses was extremely destructive, spreading to all system files it could find on the host computer (hard drive, floppy and system memory) and then destroying everything when it could no longer find any uninfected files.",

    "text": "The Michelangelo virus is a computer virus first discovered on 4 February 1991 in Australia. The virus was designed to infect DOS systems, but did not engage the operating system or make any OS calls. Michelangelo, like all boot sector viruses, operated at the BIOS level. Each year, the virus remained dormant until March 6, the birthday of Renaissance artist Michelangelo. There is no reference to the artist in the virus, and it is doubtful that the virus writer intended Michelangelo to be referenced to the virus. The name was chosen by researchers who noticed the coincidence of the activation date. The actual significance of the date to the author is unknown. Michelangelo is a variant of the already endemic Stoned virus.On March 6, if the PC is an AT or a PS/2, the virus overwrites the first one hundred sectors of the hard disk with nulls. The virus assumes a geometry of 256 cylinders, 4 heads, 17 sectors per track. Although all the user's data would still be on the hard disk, it would be irretrievable for the average user.On hard disks, the virus moves the original master boot record to cylinder 0, head 0, sector 7.\nOn floppy disks, if the disk is 360 KB, the virus moves the original boot sector to cylinder 0, head 1, sector 3.\nOn other disks, the virus moves the original boot sector to cylinder 0, head 1, sector 14.\n\nThis is the last directory of the 1.2 MB disks.\nThis is the second-to-last directory of the 1.44 MB disks.\nThe directory does not exist on 720 KB disks.Although designed to infect DOS systems, the virus can easily disrupt other operating systems installed on the system since, like many viruses of its era, the Michelangelo infects the master boot record of a hard drive. Once a system became infected, any floppy disk inserted into the system (and written to; in 1992 a PC system could not detect that a floppy had been inserted, so the virus could not infect the floppy until some access to the disk is made) becomes immediately infected as well. And because the virus spends most of its time dormant, activating only on March 6, it is conceivable that an infected computer could go for years without detection \u2014 as long as it wasn't booted on that date, while infected.\nThe virus first came to widespread international attention in January 1992, when it was revealed that a few computer and software manufacturers had accidentally shipped products, for example Intel's LANSpool print server, infected with the virus. Although the infected machines numbered only in the hundreds, the resulting publicity spiraled into \"expert\" claims, partially led by anti-virus company founder John McAfee, of thousands or even millions of computers infected by Michelangelo. However, on March 6, 1992, only 10,000 to 20,000 cases of data loss were reported.In subsequent years, users were advised not to run PCs on March 6, waiting until March 7, or else reset the PC date to March 7 at some time on March 5 (to skip March 6). Eventually, the news media lost interest, and the virus was quickly forgotten. Despite the scenario given above, in which an infected computer could evade detection for years, by 1997 no cases were being reported in the wild.",

The source code to the original nVIR has been made widely available, and so numerous variants have arisen. Each variant causes somewhat different symptoms, such as: application crashes, printing errors on laser printers, slow system response time, or unpredictable system crashes. nVIR spreads through any nVIR-infected program, but due to the long period of time nVIR lies basically dormant in a host system, nVIR generally finds its way into system backups and is not detected until the first overt symptoms appear. For example, if a disk used in an infected Macintosh is removed and inserted in a second Macintosh, the other machine will become infected if any application on that disk is executed in the second machine. Further, any method used to transfer programs between Macintoshes will spread nVIR, including file transfer over a network. However, nVIR cannot spread via a print network's hardware.\nnVIR carries an additional code resource, CODE 256 (though some variants carry CODE 255), and patches the jump table to point to it. The original application's entry point is saved in the nVIR 2 resource. nVIR introduces to the System file the INIT 32 resource which is executed at startup, at which time nVIR patches the TEInit trap. Any application subsequently calling this trap will be infected. The nVIR 3 (or nVIR 5) resource is a copy of INIT 32. An nVIR 10 resource in the System file will prevent nVIR infection. If an application calls OpenResFile prior to TEInit, that application will be damaged.\nnVIR 0 resource holds a counter that is set to 1000 on the first infection of the system. Each reboot decrements the counter by 1. Each application launch decrements it by 2. When the counter reaches 0, nVIR will beep 1 out of 8 reboots and 1 of 4 infected application launches. If MacinTalk is installed in the machine's System folder, the machine may occasionally say \"Don't Panic\". Otherwise, it may beep unexpectedly.\nnVIR has been known to 'hybridize' with different variants of nVIR on the same machine.",

Document files (usually .doc or .xls) on the infected computer were chosen at random, infected with the virus and emailed out to email addresses in the host's address book. Opening the infected file resulted in infection of the target computer. During the outbreak, many personal or private files were emailed to people who otherwise should not have received them.\nIt could also spread via open shares on a network. Sircam scanned the network for computers with shared drives and copied itself to a machine with an open (non-password protected) drive or directory. A simple RPC (Remote Procedure Call) was then executed to start the process on the target machine, usually unknown to the owner of the now-compromised computer.\nOver a year after the initial 2001 outbreak, Sircam was still in the top 10 on virus charts.",

More information on these concepts is in \"How to 0wn the Internet in your Spare Time\" by Staniford, Paxson, and Weaver (appeared in Usenix Security 2002).\nIn 2003, SQL Slammer became the first observed example of a Warhol worm. The mechanism of SQL Slammer's spread used a pseudo-random number generator seeded from a system variable to determine which IP addresses to attack next. In spite of deficiencies in its implementation, the randomized attack was highly effective.\nAccording to a CAIDA-coordinated analysis of the SQL Slammer outbreak, its growth followed an exponential curve with a doubling time of 8.5 seconds in the early phases of the attack, which was only slowed by the collapse of many networks because of the denial of service caused by SQL Slammer's traffic. 90% of all vulnerable machines were infected within 10 minutes, showing that the original estimate for infection speed was roughly correct.",

It enables a user to control a computer running the Microsoft Windows operating system from a remote location. The name is a play on words on Microsoft BackOffice Server software. It can also control multiple computers at the same time using imaging.\nBack Orifice was designed with a client\u2013server architecture.  A small and unobtrusive server program is installed on one machine, which is remotely manipulated by a client program with a graphical user interface on another computer system. The two components communicate with one another using the TCP and/or UDP network protocols.  In a reference to the Leet phenomenon, this program commonly runs on port 31337.The program debuted at DEF CON 6 on August 1, 1998. It was the brainchild of Sir Dystic, a member of the U.S. hacker organization Cult of the Dead Cow. According to the group, its purpose was to demonstrate the lack of security in Microsoft's operating system Windows 98.\nAlthough Back Orifice has legitimate purposes, such as remote administration, there are other factors that make it suited for less benign uses. The server can hide itself from cursory looks by users of the system. As the server can be installed without user interaction, it can be distributed as payload of a Trojan horse.\nFor those and other reasons, the antivirus industry immediately categorized the tool as malware and appended Back Orifice to their quarantine lists. Despite this fact, it was widely used by script kiddies because of its simple GUI and ease of installation.\nTwo sequel applications followed it, Back Orifice 2000, released in 1999, and Deep Back Orifice by French Canadian hacking group QHA.",

The latter file extension ('vbs', a type of interpreted file) was most often hidden by default on Windows computers of the time (as it is an extension for a file type that is known by Windows), leading unwitting users to think it was a normal text file. Opening the attachment activated the Visual Basic script. The worm did damage on the local machine, overwriting random types of files (including Office files, image files, and audio files; however after overwriting MP3 files the virus would hide the file), and sent a copy of itself to all addresses in the Windows Address Book used by Microsoft Outlook. In contrast, the Melissa virus only sent copies to the first 50 contacts. This made it spread much faster than any other previous email worm.\n\n",

Although it was probably intended to prove that Linux can be infected, it does not propagate very effectively because of the structure of Linux's user privilege system. The Bliss virus never became widespread, and remains chiefly a research curiosity. After the Staog virus it is the second known Linux virus.When the Bliss virus was released, antivirus software vendors and Linux distributions released security advisories to notify users of the potential risks.Debian still lists itself as vulnerable to the Bliss virus. However, due to the requirement for infection to occur under the root user, the risk is listed as minimal.\n\n",

While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem \u2013 and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and cryptocurrency are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult.\nRansomware attacks are typically carried out using a Trojan that is disguised as a legitimate file that the user is tricked into downloading or opening when it arrives as an email attachment. However, one high-profile example, the \"WannaCry worm\", traveled automatically between computers without user interaction.\nStarting from around 2012 the use of ransomware scams has grown internationally. There have been 181.5 million ransomware attacks in the first six months of 2018. This marks a 229% increase over this same time frame in 2017. In June 2013, vendor McAfee released data showing that it had collected more than double the number of samples of ransomware that quarter than it had in the same quarter of the previous year. CryptoLocker was particularly successful, procuring an estimated US $3 million before it was taken down by authorities, and CryptoWall was estimated by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to have accrued over US $18m by June 2015.",

However, unlike Blaster, it first searches for and deletes Blaster if it exists, then tries to download and install security patches from Microsoft that would prevent further infection by Blaster, so it is classified as a helpful worm. Welchia was successful in deleting Blaster, but Microsoft claimed that it was not always successful in applying their security patch.This worm infected systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows system code (TFTPD.EXE and TCP on ports 666\u2013765, and a buffer overflow of the RPC on port 135). Its method of infection is to create a remote shell and instruct the system to download the worm using TFTP.EXE. Specifically, the Welchia worm targeted machines running Windows XP.  The worm used ICMP, and in some instances flooded networks with enough ICMP traffic to cause problems.Once on the system, the worm patches the vulnerability it used to gain access (thereby actually securing the system against other attempts to exploit the same method of intrusion) and run its payload, a series of Microsoft patches. It then attempts to remove the Blaster Worm by deleting MSBLAST.EXE. If still in the system, the worm is programmed to self-remove on January 1, 2004, or after 120 days of processing, whichever comes first.\nIn September 2003, the worm was discovered on the US State Department's computer network, causing them to shut down their network for 9 hours for remediation.",

For example, 1+3 and 6-2 both achieve the same result while using different values and operations. This technique is sometimes used by computer viruses, shellcodes and computer worms to hide their presence.Encryption is the most common method to hide code. With encryption, the main body of the code (also called its payload) is encrypted and will appear meaningless. For the code to function as before, a decryption function is added to the code. When the code is executed this function reads the payload and decrypts it before executing it in turn.\nEncryption alone is not polymorphism. To gain polymorphic behavior, the encryptor/decryptor pair are mutated with each copy of the code. This allows different versions of some code which all function the same.",

The term rootkit is a concatenation of \"root\" (the traditional name of the privileged account on Unix-like operating systems) and the word \"kit\" (which refers to the software components that implement the tool). The term \"rootkit\" has negative connotations through its association with malware.Rootkit installation can be automated, or an attacker can install it after having obtained root or Administrator access. Obtaining this access is a result of direct attack on a system, i.e. exploiting a known vulnerability (such as privilege escalation) or a password (obtained by cracking or social engineering tactics like \"phishing\"). Once installed, it becomes possible to hide the intrusion as well as to maintain privileged access. The key is the root or administrator access. Full control over a system means that existing software can be modified, including software that might otherwise be used to detect or circumvent it.\nRootkit detection is difficult because a rootkit may be able to subvert the software that is intended to find it. Detection methods include using an alternative and trusted operating system, behavioral-based methods, signature scanning, difference scanning, and memory dump analysis. Removal can be complicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only available solution to the problem. When dealing with firmware rootkits, removal may require hardware replacement, or specialized equipment.",

    "text": "A computer virus is a type of malicious software that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be \"infected\" with a computer virus.Virus writers use social engineering deceptions and exploit detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities to initially infect systems and to spread the virus. The vast majority of viruses target systems running Microsoft Windows, employing a variety of mechanisms to infect new hosts, and often using complex anti-detection/stealth strategies to evade antivirus software. Motives for creating viruses can include seeking profit (e.g., with ransomware), desire to send a political message, personal amusement, to demonstrate that a vulnerability exists in software, for sabotage and denial of service, or simply because they wish to explore cybersecurity issues, artificial life and evolutionary algorithms.Computer viruses currently cause billions of dollars' worth of economic damage each year,  due to causing system failure, wasting computer resources, corrupting data, increasing maintenance costs, etc. In response, free, open-source antivirus tools have been developed, and an industry of antivirus software has cropped up, selling or freely distributing virus protection to users of various operating systems. As of  2005, even though no currently existing antivirus software was able to uncover all computer viruses (especially new ones), computer security researchers are actively searching for new ways to enable antivirus solutions to more effectively detect emerging viruses, before they have already become widely distributed.The term \"virus\" is also commonly, but erroneously, used to refer to other types of malware. \"Malware\" encompasses computer viruses along with many other forms of malicious software, such as computer \"worms\", ransomware, spyware, adware, trojan horses, keyloggers, rootkits, bootkits, malicious Browser Helper Object (BHOs), and other malicious software. The majority of active malware threats are actually trojan horse programs or computer worms rather than computer viruses. The term computer virus, coined by Fred Cohen in 1985, is a misnomer. Viruses often perform some type of harmful activity on infected host computers, such as acquisition of hard disk space or central processing unit (CPU) time, accessing private information (e.g., credit card numbers), corrupting data, displaying political or humorous messages on the user's screen, spamming their e-mail contacts, logging their keystrokes, or even rendering the computer useless. However, not all viruses carry a destructive \"payload\" and attempt to hide themselves\u2014the defining characteristic of viruses is that they are self-replicating computer programs which modify other software without user consent.",

Thought to have been in development since at least 2005, Stuxnet targets SCADA systems and is believed to be responsible for causing substantial damage to Iran's nuclear program. Although neither country has openly admitted responsibility, the worm is believed to be a jointly built American/Israeli cyberweapon.Stuxnet specifically targets programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which allow the automation of electromechanical processes such as those used to control machinery and industrial processes including centrifuges for separating nuclear material. Exploiting four zero-day flaws, Stuxnet functions by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks, then seeking out Siemens Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart. Stuxnet\u2019s design and architecture are not domain-specific and it could be tailored as a platform for attacking modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and PLC systems (e.g., in factory assembly lines or power plants), the majority of which reside in Europe, Japan and the US. Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges. Targeting industrial control systems, the worm infected over 200,000 computers and caused 1,000 machines to physically degrade.Stuxnet has three modules: a worm that executes all routines related to the main payload of the attack; a link file that automatically executes the propagated copies of the worm; and a rootkit component responsible for hiding all malicious files and processes, preventing detection of the presence of Stuxnet. It is typically introduced to the target environment via an infected USB flash drive, thereby crossing any air gap. The worm then propagates across the network, scanning for Siemens Step7 software on computers controlling a PLC. In the absence of either criterion, Stuxnet becomes dormant inside the computer. If both the conditions are fulfilled, Stuxnet introduces the infected rootkit onto the PLC and Step7 software, modifying the code and giving unexpected commands to the PLC while returning a loop of normal operations system values feedback to the users.In 2015, Kaspersky Lab noted that the Equation Group had used two of the same zero-day attacks, prior to their use in Stuxnet, and commented that: \"the similar type of usage of both exploits together in different computer worms, at around the same time, indicates that the Equation Group and the Stuxnet developers are either the same or working closely together\".",
